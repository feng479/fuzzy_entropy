# fuzzy_entropy
Functionality:
This function implements the basic calculation of fuzzy entropy.
Usage:

Prepare input data as a pandas DataFrame, where each column represents a time series.
Call the calculate_fuzzy_entropy(data) function to compute the fuzzy entropy for each column.
Notes:

This is a simplified version that only demonstrates the basic fuzzy entropy calculation process.
Sliding window and additional details are not included in this version.
